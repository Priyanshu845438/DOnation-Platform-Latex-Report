\chapter{Results and Discussion}

\section{Introduction}
This chapter presents the **results obtained** from the implementation and testing of the **Donation Platform with Payment Gateway**. It discusses the platform’s **performance, usability, and effectiveness**, followed by an in-depth analysis of key findings. The discussion also highlights challenges encountered during development and possible solutions.

\section{System Performance Evaluation}
The platform was evaluated based on several key performance indicators (KPIs), including **response time, transaction success rate, user experience, and security measures**.

\subsection{Response Time Analysis}
To ensure a smooth donation process, the system’s response time was measured under different loads. The average response time for key functionalities was recorded as follows:

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|l|c|}
        \hline
        \textbf{Functionality} & \textbf{Average Response Time (ms)} \\
        \hline
        User Login & 250 ms \\
        Donation Processing & 500 ms \\
        Campaign Page Load & 300 ms \\
        NGO Profile Retrieval & 400 ms \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{System Response Time for Key Functionalities}
    \label{table:response_time}
\end{table}

The results indicate that the system **performs efficiently**, with response times within acceptable limits.

\subsection{Transaction Success Rate}
The success rate of transactions was analyzed based on **successful, failed, and pending transactions**.

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
        \hline
        \textbf{Transaction Type} & \textbf{Percentage (\%)} \\
        \hline
        Successful Transactions & 96.5\% \\
        Failed Transactions & 2.0\% \\
        Pending Transactions & 1.5\% \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Transaction Success Rate}
    \label{table:transaction_success}
\end{table}

The **high success rate (96.5\%)** confirms that the **payment gateway integration is stable and reliable**.

\section{User Experience and Feedback}
User feedback was collected through **surveys and usability tests**. The following factors were considered:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Ease of Use}: Users found the interface intuitive and easy to navigate.
    \item \textbf{Donation Process Simplicity}: The one-click donation system was highly rated.
    \item \textbf{Security Perception}: Users appreciated the secure payment gateway and authentication mechanisms.
\end{itemize}

The majority of users rated the platform **above 4.5/5** in terms of overall experience.

\section{Challenges and Solutions}
During development and testing, several challenges were encountered, along with the solutions implemented:

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|p{6cm}|p{6cm}|}
        \hline
        \textbf{Challenge} & \textbf{Solution Implemented} \\
        \hline
        Payment gateway transaction failures in testing mode & Integrated sandbox testing with real-time monitoring \\
        \hline
        Load balancing issues during high-traffic scenarios & Implemented AWS Load Balancer to distribute traffic \\
        \hline
        Security concerns related to user authentication & Used JWT-based authentication with role-based access control \\
        \hline
        Scalability concerns for future expansion & Designed a microservices architecture for modular scalability \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Challenges Faced and Solutions Implemented}
    \label{table:challenges_solutions}
\end{table}

\section{Discussion on Findings}
