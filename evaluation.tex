\chapter{Evaluation}

\section{Introduction}
Evaluation is a critical phase in assessing the effectiveness, performance, and usability of the **Donation Platform with Payment Gateway**. This chapter presents the evaluation methodology, criteria used for assessment, and the results obtained through various testing methods, including **functional testing, performance testing, security testing, and user feedback analysis**.

\section{Evaluation Criteria}
The system was evaluated based on the following key criteria:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Functionality:} Ensuring all features work as intended.
    \item \textbf{Performance:} Measuring response time, load handling, and database efficiency.
    \item \textbf{Security:} Assessing authentication mechanisms, data encryption, and protection against vulnerabilities.
    \item \textbf{Usability:} Analyzing user experience, ease of navigation, and accessibility.
    \item \textbf{Scalability:} Evaluating the system's ability to handle an increasing number of users and transactions.
\end{itemize}

\section{Functional Testing}
Functional testing was performed to verify that each module operates correctly. The test cases were designed to cover:

\begin{itemize}
    \item **User Authentication:** Tested login, registration, and role-based access control.
    \item **Donation Processing:** Ensured successful transaction completion via **Cashfree Payment Gateway**.
    \item **Campaign Management:** Verified NGO campaign creation, updates, and donation tracking.
    \item **Admin Panel:** Checked functionalities such as approving NGOs, managing donations, and viewing reports.
\end{itemize}

All test cases passed successfully, confirming that the system functions as expected.

\section{Performance Testing}
Performance tests were conducted to assess system responsiveness and scalability. The following metrics were recorded:

\begin{itemize}
    \item **Average Response Time:** \textit{200-300ms per API call}.
    \item **Maximum Concurrent Users Handled:** \textit{500 active users without performance degradation}.
    \item **Database Query Optimization:** Indexed frequently accessed data to improve retrieval speed.
\end{itemize}

\section{Security Testing}
Security assessments included:

\begin{itemize}
    \item **Authentication Security:** Implemented **JWT authentication** and strong password hashing.
    \item **Data Protection:** Enforced **HTTPS encryption** for secure data transmission.
    \item **SQL/NoSQL Injection Protection:** Used ORM techniques and parameterized queries.
    \item **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention:** Validated and sanitized user inputs.
\end{itemize}

No critical vulnerabilities were found, ensuring a secure platform.

\section{User Feedback and Usability Testing}
User testing was conducted with **NGOs, donors, and administrators**. Feedback was collected through surveys and direct observations. Key findings:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Positive Aspects:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item **Easy navigation** and intuitive UI.
        \item **Smooth donation process** with clear transaction status updates.
        \item **Detailed reporting features** in the admin panel.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Areas for Improvement:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Implement **mobile app support** for better accessibility.
        \item Add **multi-language support** for a wider audience.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Comparison with Existing Systems}
A comparative analysis was performed against existing donation platforms. The **Donation Platform with Payment Gateway** showed improvements in:

\begin{itemize}
    \item **Transaction Speed:** Faster processing times compared to traditional donation systems.
    \item **Security Features:** Enhanced **role-based access control** and **real-time fraud detection**.
    \item **Transparency:** Detailed reporting features for tracking every donation.
\end{itemize}
